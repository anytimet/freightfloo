            <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-8">
              The freight and logistics industry is undergoing a technological revolution. From artificial intelligence to Internet of Things (IoT) devices, new technologies are reshaping how goods are transported, tracked, and delivered.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Artificial Intelligence in Logistics</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              AI is transforming freight operations through predictive analytics, route optimization, and demand forecasting. Machine learning algorithms can predict maintenance needs, optimize delivery routes, and even predict shipping delays before they occur.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Internet of Things (IoT) Integration</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              IoT sensors provide real-time visibility into shipment conditions, location tracking, and environmental monitoring. Smart containers can monitor temperature, humidity, and security, ensuring cargo integrity throughout the supply chain.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Self-driving trucks are becoming a reality, promising to reduce labor costs and improve safety. While fully autonomous vehicles are still in development, semi-autonomous features like lane-keeping and adaptive cruise control are already improving efficiency.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Blockchain for Supply Chain Transparency</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Blockchain technology provides immutable records of shipments, ensuring transparency and reducing fraud. Smart contracts can automate payments and documentation, streamlining the entire shipping process.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Digital Freight Marketplaces</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Platforms like FreightFloo are revolutionizing how shippers and carriers connect. These digital marketplaces provide instant rate comparisons, automated matching, and streamlined booking processes.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Predictive Analytics</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Advanced analytics help predict demand patterns, optimize inventory levels, and identify potential disruptions. This proactive approach reduces costs and improves service reliability.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Green Technology</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles are reducing the carbon footprint of freight transportation. Smart routing and load optimization further contribute to environmental sustainability.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Road Ahead</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              As these technologies mature, we can expect even greater integration and automation in freight operations. The future promises more efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective shipping solutions for businesses worldwide.
