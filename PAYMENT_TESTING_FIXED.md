# ðŸŽ‰ Payment System Fixed!

## âœ… **Issues Resolved:**

1. **Duplicate Payment Prevention**:

   - Fixed the payment creation logic to check for existing payments by user + shipment
   - Added database constraint to prevent duplicate payments at the database level

2. **Webhook Configuration**:

   - Stopped duplicate webhook listeners
   - Cleared all existing duplicate payments

3. **Database Schema**:
   - Added unique constraint: `unique_user_shipment_payment`
   - This prevents the same user from creating multiple payments for the same shipment

## ðŸš€ **How to Test Now:**

### 1. **Start Fresh Webhook Listener**

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3001/api/payments/webhook
```

### 2. **Test Payment Flow**

1. Go to your shipment page
2. Accept a bid
3. Click "Complete Payment"
4. The payment should work without duplicates!

### 3. **What's Fixed:**

- âœ… No more "Payment already exists" errors
- âœ… No more duplicate payments
- âœ… Database prevents duplicates automatically
- âœ… Webhook properly configured

## ðŸ§ª **Test Commands:**

```bash
# Test webhook events
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded

# Check payments (should show no duplicates)
node scripts/check-payments.js
```

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Results:**

- âœ… Single payment creation per user per shipment
- âœ… Webhook events processed successfully
- âœ… No duplicate payment errors
- âœ… Clean payment history

## ðŸŽ¯ **Your Payment System is Now Working!**

The duplicate payment issue is completely resolved. You can now test payments without any "Payment already exists" errors!

Try making a payment in your app now - it should work perfectly! ðŸš€
