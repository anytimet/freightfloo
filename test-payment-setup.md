# ðŸ§ª Payment Testing Setup

## âœ… Issues Fixed:

1. **Webhook Port**: Updated to forward to port 3001 (where your app is running)
2. **Security Settings**: Made more lenient for development:
   - Account age: 1 minute (instead of 24 hours)
   - Email verification: Skipped in development

## ðŸš€ How to Test Payments:

### Option 1: Wait 1 Minute

If you just created your account, wait 1 minute and try the payment again.

### Option 2: Use an Existing Account

If you have an older account, use that for testing.

### Option 3: Create a Test Account

1. Create a new account
2. Wait 1 minute
3. Try the payment

## ðŸ”§ Current Status:

- âœ… **Webhook**: Forwarding to correct port (3001)
- âœ… **Security**: Development-friendly settings
- âœ… **App**: Running on localhost:3001
- âœ… **Stripe CLI**: Connected and working

## ðŸ§ª Test Commands:

```bash
# Test webhook events
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
stripe trigger payment_intent.payment_failed

# Check webhook logs
# Look at your terminal where stripe listen is running
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results:

After the fixes, you should see:

- âœ… Webhook events received (200 status instead of 400)
- âœ… Payment security checks pass for accounts older than 1 minute
- âœ… Payment processing works in your app

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps:

1. **Wait 1 minute** if using a new account
2. **Try the payment again** in your app
3. **Check webhook logs** for successful processing
4. **Verify database updates** after payment

Your payment system should now work properly! ðŸŽ‰
